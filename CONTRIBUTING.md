## üìù Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide

```javascript
// Use descriptive variable names
const restrictedApplications = ["steam.exe", "discord.exe"];

// Use async/await for promises
async function checkForViolations() {
  try {
    const violations = await detectRestrictedApps();
    return violations;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error checking violations:", error);
    return [];
  }
}

// Use clear function names
function sendDiscordNotification(message) {
  // Implementation
}

// Add comments for complex logic
// Rate limiting: only send notifications once per minute per violation
const oneMinuteAgo = now - 60 * 1000;
```

### HTML/CSS Guidelines

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Keep CSS organized and commented
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Make UI responsive and accessible
- Follow existing design patterns

### File Organization

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js          # Main process - app logic, IPC handlers, auto-updater
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preload.js        # Preload script - secure IPC bridge
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html        # UI structure and frontend logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css         # Styles and theming

.github/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-and-release.yml  # Automated builds & releases
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test.yml               # Test automation

forge.config.js       # Electron Forge configuration
package.json          # Dependencies, scripts, auto-updater config
```

### Key Technologies

- **Electron** - Desktop app framework
- **electron-forge** - Build and packaging system
- **electron-updater** - Auto-update functionality
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD for automated builds
- **Discord Webhooks** - Accountability notifications

### IPC Communication Pattern

```javascript
// Main process (index.js)
ipcMain.handle("action-name", async (event, param) => {
  // Handle the action
  return result;
});

// Preload script (preload.js)
contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("electronAPI", {
  actionName: (param) => ipcRenderer.invoke("action-name", param),
});

// Renderer process (index.html)
const result = await window.electronAPI.actionName(param);
```

3. **Test the accountability features** - ensure explanations are still required
4. **Test Discord integration** with a real webhook
5. **Test system tray functionality**

### Common Development Tasks

```bash
# Start with development tools open
NODE_ENV=development npm start

# Package the app for testing
npm run package

# Create distributable builds
npm run make

# Reset settings during development
# Delete: %APPDATA%/not-enough-accountability/ (Windows)
# Delete: ~/Library/Application Support/not-enough-accountability/ (macOS)
```

### Debugging

- Use `console.log()` statements in main process
- Use browser developer tools for renderer process
- Check the activity log in the app for runtime errors
- Use `NODE_ENV=development` for additional debug output
