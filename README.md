## üöÄ Download & Installation

### Quick Download

Get the latest version from our [Releases page](https://github.com/chaosweasl/not-enough-accountability/releases):

- **Windows**: Download `Not-Enough-Accountability-Setup.exe`
- **macOS**: Download `Not-Enough-Accountability.dmg`

### Installation Steps

1. **Download** the appropriate file for your operating system
2. **Install/Run** the application:
   - **Windows**: Double-click the `.exe` file and follow the installer
   - **macOS**: Open the `.dmg` file and drag the app to Applications
3. **First launch**: The app will open with a setup wizard

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

**Important:** This application is not code-signed, which means your operating system may display security warnings:

- **Windows**: Windows Defender or antivirus software may flag the app as "potentially unwanted" or block installation
  - Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway" if Windows SmartScreen blocks it
  - You may need to temporarily disable real-time protection in Windows Defender
  - Add the app folder to your antivirus exclusions if needed

- **macOS**: macOS Gatekeeper may prevent opening the app
  - Right-click the app ‚Üí "Open" ‚Üí "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper
  - Or go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí "Open Anyway"

- **Why this happens**: Code signing certificates are expensive ($400+/year) for open-source projects
- **Is it safe?**: Yes! The source code is fully open and auditable on GitHub
- **Alternative**: Build from source if you prefer (see CONTRIBUTING.md)

### First Time Setup

1. **Configure Discord Webhook** (Recommended)
   - Create a Discord webhook in your server/channel
   - Paste the webhook URL in the app settings
   - Test the connection

2. **Set Work Hours**
   - Configure your check-in time (default: 08:00)
   - Configure your check-out time (default: 16:00)

3. **Add Restricted Items**
   - Add applications you want to avoid (e.g., `steam.exe`, `chrome.exe`)
   - Add keywords to monitor (e.g., `youtube`, `netflix`, `reddit`)

4. **Save Settings** and start monitoring!

### Auto-Updates

The app includes automatic update functionality:

- **Automatic Check**: Checks for updates on startup
- **Manual Check**: Use the "Check for Updates" button in settings
- **Background Download**: Updates download in the background
- **Install Prompt**: You'll be prompted when an update is ready to install

## üîß Configuration

### Discord Webhook Setup

1. Go to your Discord server settings
2. Navigate to Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Create a new webhook
4. Copy the webhook URL
5. Paste it into the app's Discord Webhook URL field

### Adding Restricted Applications

- Use the executable name (e.g., `steam.exe`, `discord.exe`)
- On Windows, you can find process names in Task Manager
- The app will detect partial matches (e.g., `steam` will match `steam.exe`)

### Adding Monitoring Keywords

- Keywords are detected in window titles
- Works great for browser tabs (YouTube, Netflix, Reddit, etc.)
- Case-insensitive matching
- Detects keywords in any application window title

## üñ•Ô∏è System Tray

The app runs in the system tray with these options:

- **Show App** - Bring the main window to front
- **Check In/Out** - Quick check-in or check-out
- **Start/Stop Monitoring** - Toggle monitoring state
- **Quit** - Exit the app (requires explanation)

## üìã How It Works

### Monitoring Process

1. **Every 5 seconds**: Checks running processes and active window titles
2. **Violation Detection**: Compares against your restricted apps and keywords
3. **Rate Limiting**: Only sends notifications once per minute per violation
4. **Discord Notification**: Sends detailed violation info to your Discord channel

### Accountability System

- All control actions require written explanations
- Explanations are logged locally and sent to Discord
- Creates an audit trail of when and why monitoring was disabled
- Prevents impulsive disabling of monitoring

### Work Hour Integration

- Automatically starts monitoring during configured work hours
- Auto check-in/check-out at scheduled times
- Pausing monitoring automatically resumes during work hours

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage**: All settings and logs stored locally on your computer
- **No Data Collection**: The app doesn't send any data except Discord notifications
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for inspection
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses only essential, trusted packages

4. Create a new issue with detailed information

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18+ recommended (v16.14+ minimum for stable ESM support)
- **npm**: v8+ (comes with Node.js)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chaosweasl/not-enough-accountability.git
cd not-enough-accountability

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development (runs both renderer and Electron)
npm run dev
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start both Vite dev server and Electron app
- `npm run dev:renderer` - Start only the Vite dev server (browser mode)
- `npm run dev:electron` - Start only Electron (requires renderer running)
- `npm run build` - Build production version
- `npm run build:main` - Build main process only
- `npm run build:renderer` - Build renderer only
- `npm run package` - Package the app for distribution

### Architecture

This app uses:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Electron main process (Node.js)
- **Build Tools**: Vite + PostCSS
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS via PostCSS plugin (avoids ESM/CJS conflicts)

### Tailwind CSS Setup

The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS integration:

- **Configuration**: `postcss.config.js` + `tailwind.config.js`
- **Import**: Tailwind is imported via `@import 'tailwindcss';` in CSS files
- **Plugin**: Uses `@tailwindcss/postcss` (not `@tailwindcss/vite`) for broader compatibility
- **Custom Colors**: Defines `primary-*` color palette in `tailwind.config.js`

If you encounter Tailwind-related issues:
1. Ensure Node.js v18+ for best ESM support
2. Check that PostCSS config exists and includes `@tailwindcss/postcss`
3. Verify `@import 'tailwindcss';` is in your CSS entry point
4. Run `npm run dev:renderer` to test Vite compilation only

### Electron + Vite Integration

The setup separates concerns:
- **Renderer Process**: Built with Vite (ESM-friendly)
- **Main Process**: Built with TypeScript compiler (CommonJS compatible)
- **Development**: Hot reloading for renderer, restart for main process

### Testing Tailwind

To verify Tailwind is working, you can import the test component:
```typescript
import TailwindTest from './components/TailwindTest';
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This app is designed to help with self-accountability and should not be considered a security tool. Determined users can always disable or bypass the monitoring. The effectiveness depends on your commitment to using it honestly.
