### Installation Steps

   - **Linux**: Make the `.AppImage` executable and run it
3. **First launch**: The app will open with a setup wizard

### First Time Setup

1. **Configure Discord Webhook** (Recommended)
   - Create a Discord webhook in your server/channel
   - Paste the webhook URL in the app settings
   - Test the connection

2. **Set Work Hours**
   - Configure your check-in time (default: 08:00)
   - Configure your check-out time (default: 16:00)

3. **Add Restricted Items**
   - Add applications you want to avoid (e.g., `steam.exe`, `chrome.exe`)
   - Add keywords to monitor (e.g., `youtube`, `netflix`, `reddit`)

4. **Save Settings** and start monitoring!

### Auto-Updates

The app includes automatic update functionality:

- **Automatic Check**: Checks for updates on startup
- **Manual Check**: Use the "Check for Updates" button in settings
- **Background Download**: Updates download in the background
- **Install Prompt**: You'll be prompted when an update is ready to install

## üîß Configuration

### Discord Webhook Setup

1. Go to your Discord server settings
2. Navigate to Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Create a new webhook
4. Copy the webhook URL
5. Paste it into the app's Discord Webhook URL field

### Adding Restricted Applications

- Use the executable name (e.g., `steam.exe`, `discord.exe`)
- On Windows, you can find process names in Task Manager
- The app will detect partial matches (e.g., `steam` will match `steam.exe`)

### Adding Monitoring Keywords

- Keywords are detected in window titles
- Works great for browser tabs (YouTube, Netflix, Reddit, etc.)
- Case-insensitive matching
- Detects keywords in any application window title

## üñ•Ô∏è System Tray

The app runs in the system tray with these options:

- **Show App** - Bring the main window to front
- **Check In/Out** - Quick check-in or check-out
- **Start/Stop Monitoring** - Toggle monitoring state
- **Quit** - Exit the app (requires explanation)

## üìã How It Works

### Monitoring Process

1. **Every 5 seconds**: Checks running processes and active window titles
2. **Violation Detection**: Compares against your restricted apps and keywords
3. **Rate Limiting**: Only sends notifications once per minute per violation
4. **Discord Notification**: Sends detailed violation info to your Discord channel

### Accountability System

- All control actions require written explanations
- Explanations are logged locally and sent to Discord
- Creates an audit trail of when and why monitoring was disabled
- Prevents impulsive disabling of monitoring

### Work Hour Integration

- Automatically starts monitoring during configured work hours
- Auto check-in/check-out at scheduled times
- Pausing monitoring automatically resumes during work hours

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage**: All settings and logs stored locally on your computer
- **No Data Collection**: The app doesn't send any data except Discord notifications
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for inspection
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses only essential, trusted packages
