your task is to create a project that students and people can use as an accountability tool. the goal is to make an application blocker and tracker that blocks things remotely with a pin code (and a killswitch for safety issues). the user should be able to select apps to block based on the applications they have on their computer. they should also have the option to connect this app to a discord webhook for extra accountability by sending messages if they disable or enable certain applications

it should also be able to identify currently open web pages (without making it into a seperate extension for web) and be able to block websites too like youtube or other stuff

the app should look modern and be safe, like a modern real-world tool

no pricing plan, just free open source accountability for anyone to downlaod and use

the app will be using tauri & react alongside tailwind and shadcn UI

make it beautiful. make it simple to use, and try to keep it as lightweight as possible, but make it damn good

the app should have features like:

- ability to block apps on a timer or on certain days (e.g no games on weekdays until X hour, or block these apps for X minutes, etc...) and the user should connect messages like these to a webhook on discord IF they want to. its fully optional
- set up a pin so they can't cheat (and add a killswitch for safety but it sends an alert on webhook)
- feel like a proper tool anyone can use, not just students or people who need to study

more context behind the app:

- it will be avialable on github, publicly avialable for anyone to dowlnoad
- it will not have a database (besides localstorage and other things like that)
- it will not collect any user information
- just a simple but neat open-source tool for people to use
